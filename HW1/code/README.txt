Libraries Used:pandasitertoolscollectionsUsage Instructions:1. For generating the frequent itemsets for any given support value, edit the support value according to your wish in main_freq_itemset.py.2. For Generating all the rules, you can run the function rg() in rulegen.py with desired support and confidence values.3. For generating the rules following template 1, please run the Template1.py by editing the values of the variables. Note, for variable definitions, I followed the format given under HW1 dataset explanation.4. For generating the rules following template 2, please run the Template2.py by editing the values of the variables. Note, for variable definitions, I followed the format given under HW1 dataset explanation5. For generating the rules following template 3, please run the Template3.py by editing the values of the variables. Note, for variable definitions, I followed the format given under HW! dataset explanation. I was not able to fully put this in a method. So, I have uploaded a demo of the input queries for result32 in the file Demo_temp3.ipynb.
